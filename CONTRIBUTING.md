This is a oneoff personal project. While the code is provided open source
under the Apache 2.0 license, please set expectations accordingly:

- We are unlikely to review or merge pull requests. This isn't a reflection
  on the quality of your contribution; we simply don't have the bandwidth to
  maintain an active review process.

- Bug reports are welcome via GitHub Issues, but we may not address them
  promptly (or at all).

- Forking is encouraged. If you have ideas for improvements, you are
  welcome to fork the repository, make your changes, and publish your own
  version.
